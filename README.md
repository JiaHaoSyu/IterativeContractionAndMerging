# Hierarchical Image Segmentation based on Iterative Contraction and Merging (TIP2017)
The code is created based on the following paper:

[Jia-Hao Syu](https://sites.google.com/view/jiahaosyu/home), [Sheng-Jyh Wang](http://vlab.ee.nctu.edu.tw/advisor/), and [Li-Chun Wang](http://lichun.cm.nctu.edu.tw/), "Hierarchical Image Segmentation based % on Iterative Contraction and Merging Process," IEEE Transaction on Image Process, 2017.

Usage:

Step1 

   Run compiler.m  to compiler the Mex-file 

Step2

   Run Demo.m for single color image 

Three types of output:

   Type I : Superpixel-like segmentation
  
   Type II : Hierarchical image segmentations
  
   Type III : Video of all process result of iterative contraction-and-merging process
