# Hierarchical Image Segmentation based on Iterative Contraction and Merging (TIP2017)
The code is created based on the following paper:

[Jia-Hao Syu](https://sites.google.com/view/jiahaosyu/home), [Sheng-Jyh Wang](http://vlab.ee.nctu.edu.tw/advisor/), and [Li-Chun Wang](http://lichun.cm.nctu.edu.tw/), "Hierarchical Image Segmentation based % on Iterative Contraction and Merging Process," IEEE Transaction on Image Process, 2017.

# Example:<br>
+ Step1 <br>
Run compiler.m  to compiler the Mex-file <br>
+ Step2 <br>
Run Demo.m for single color image <br>

Three types of output can be choosen in Demo.m:<br>
+ Type = 'Segs' : Superpixel-like segmentation<br>
+ Type = 'Hier' : Hierarchical image segmentations<br>
+ Type = 'Video': Video of all process result of iterative contraction-and-merging process<br>
